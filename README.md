kgrep
=====

Roughly speaking, a 'grep' for k-mers

The primary use case is the recruitment of metagenomic proxy reads, starting from a set of single cell reads. Assembling these instead of the single cell reads into a so-called metagenomic proxy assembly usually results in a nicer assembly.
You can also use the tool to quickly identify contaminants or, because it is insanely fast, screen multiple metagenomes for the abundance of any genome of interest.
